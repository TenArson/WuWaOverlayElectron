Notes

Be sure to unbind your F keys ingame of course to make those keys work

This needs admin clearance to be able to function because windows locks the f keys down on games for some reason

The overlay works even on borderless fullscreen games.

This is a local-only tool, no server or data collection.

⚠️ USE AT YOUR OWN RISK I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY KIND OF PUNISHEMENT FROM THE GAME ⚠️ the overlay should be safe from any form of sanctions but i have to disclose it because i do not know the rules for this kind of things

I don’t plan on updating it unless its broken, so just have fun with this little project!

From France with love,
